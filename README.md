# Airplane-Factorial-Design
This study aims to analyze how the placement of paper clips on a paper airplane-at the nose, middle, or rear-affect its flight distance. 
A full factorial design is utilized with 3 factors, each with 2 levels: the attachment of a paper clip on the nose, middle, and rear of the plane.
