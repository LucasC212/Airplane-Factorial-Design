# Introduction

Paper airplanes have long been a fun and creative craft to engage children, but their 
flight dynamics also tie into real principles of aerodynamics. The factors affecting 
the flight of paper airplanes like weight distribution, mass of the plane, and drag, 
parallel those affecting real aircraft. Understanding how these changes made to the 
paper airplane's design impact its flight can offer insights into how 
small alterations in mass, aerodynamics, and fuel amount influence the flight distance 
of real airplanes \cite{Sun2020, Filippone2008}. 

This study aims to analyze how the placement of paper clips on a paper airplane-at 
the nose, middle, or rear-affect its flight distance. The weight distribution, altered 
with paper clip placement, can significantly affect the plane's center of gravity, lift, 
and drag, causing resistance on the aircraft as well as risk for backflip when the 
aircraft is not weighted sufficiently in the nose \cite{Harikumar2020, Pan2024}. By 
testing different architectures and with statistical analysis, this experiment will 
provide insights into the optimal weight distribution to maximize flight distance.

# Methods

The design of this experiment was a full factorial design with 3 factors, each 
with two levels: the attachment of a paper clip on the nose, middle, and rear of 
the plane, with levels 0 and 1, where 1 represents the presence of the paper clip 
corresponding to its factor. To collect data, 
the paper airplane was thrown along a measuring tape with different treatments 
according to all 8 combinations of the factors: 
no paper clips, nose paper clip, middle paper clip, rear paper clip, nose and middle 
paper clip, nose and rear paper clip, middle and rear paper clip, and nose and middle 
and rear paper clip. Each distance that the airplane flew under the specific conditions 
was recorded into an Excel spreadsheet in inches. The flight distance was determined by 
the spot the airplane first hit the ground, recorded to my best 
ability, since my vantage point was usually 14 feet away from this spot. The order 
of data collection was randomized with the base R `sample` function. Once I listed out 
12 full replicates of the 8 possible factor combinations
(determined through sample size calculations & recommended by Professor Chi) into Excel, 
the random sample shuffled the order of these factors before the data collection started. 
Then I wrote the shuffled data into an Excel file, added the `Distance` column, and 
loaded this data back into R.

```

The question to be answered was whether or not any combination of placing a paper clip 
on the nose, middle, and rear of a paper airplane has any effect on flight distance. 
For statistical analysis, a linear regression model was used as well as a permutation 
test for a non-parametric method.

For a linear regression model, the data is assumed to be normally distributed, not 
structured, and have equal or constant variance (homoscedasticity). 
In this respect, it is possible that the data did not follow a normal distribution and
homoscedasticity was not maintained due to inconsistencies in my throwing technique, 
physical fatigue, and deterioration of the paper airplane. A thorough analysis of whether 
or not these assumptions were met will be given in the Results section.

A technical issue that arose during the experiment was that after repeated 
trials, the nose of the paper airplane became crumpled, since it often hit the ground 
nose first. Additionally, a few flights ended inconclusively due to the interference 
of a counter-top next to the flight zone in which the trial for that factor or combination 
of factors was repeated. Moreover, I initially was not consistent with my tosses, 
potentially skewing data in the beginning of the experiment, however my throwing technique improved after several replicates.

```

Per sample size calculations, assuming a best case smaller standard error of 7.8 
for $\beta$ estimates, at least 6 replicates are required to get 80\% power (1 replicate
represents all 8 combinations of the factors). However, using the middle standard error
estimate for $\beta$, 16.4, less than 50\% power is obtained with 10 full replicates 
and barely 12\% power is reached in 10 replicates in the case of a high $\beta$ standard 
error of 41. These standard error values were calculated by reducing the lowest observed
standard error by 33\% and increasing the highest standard error value by
25\%. The middle standard error value was kept the same as observed in the pilot study.

Because of feasibility, the most replicates that will be collected will be 12 (96 
observations), which can still provide almost 100\% power if there is a lower standard 
error of 7.8. 

Since this data is intended for use as a pilot study, these calculations were done before
collecting the real experimental data. Now, the required number of replicates to get 
sufficient power over a range of potential $\beta$ standard error values is known.

\textbf{Experimental data with 12 replicates:}

Visualizations:
```{r}
# Randomization of the order of data collection:

# tmp_airplane <- read_excel("tmp_airplane.xlsx")
# shuffled_tmp_airplane <- tmp_airplane[sample(nrow(tmp_airplane)), ] 
# write_xlsx(shuffled_tmp_airplane, "shuffled_airplane.xlsx")
# Now the order of data collection has been randomized 

paper_airplane <- read_excel("shuffled_airplane.xlsx", 
                             col_types = c("numeric", "text", "text", "text"))
# The col "Distance" has been added into the excel file and loaded back to R as paper_airplane

ggplot(data=paper_airplane, mapping=aes(x=Nose, y=Distance, color=Middle)) + 
  geom_jitter(width = 0.15, height = 0) + 
  facet_grid(cols = vars(Rear), 
             labeller = labeller(Rear = c("0" = "No Rear Paper Clip", 
                                          "1" = "Rear Paper Clip"))) + 
  ggtitle("Paper airplane distance based on paper clip placement") + 
  scale_x_discrete(name = "Nose Paper Clip", labels = c("No", "Yes")) + 
  scale_color_discrete(name = "Middle Paper Clip", labels = c("No", "Yes"))

ggplot(data=paper_airplane, mapping=aes(x=Nose, y=Distance, fill=Middle)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  facet_grid(cols = vars(Rear), 
             labeller = labeller(Rear = c("0" = "No Rear Paper Clip", 
                                          "1" = "Rear Paper Clip"))) + 
  ggtitle("Paper airplane distance based on paper clip placement") + 
  scale_x_discrete(name = "Nose Paper Clip", labels = c("No", "Yes")) + 
  scale_fill_discrete(name = "Middle Paper Clip", labels = c("No", "Yes"))
```

Based on the visualizations of the data, there are not many apparent trends except for 
a slight increase in overall flight distance when the rear paper clip is present and 
the nose paper clip is not. It is more apparent in the boxplot that the presence 
of a middle paper clip creates more low flying distance values than other combinations.

Summary statistics:
```{r, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)

summary_stats <- paper_airplane %>% 
  group_by(Nose, Middle, Rear) %>% 
  summarize(Mean = signif(mean(Distance), 4),
            Sd = signif(sd(Distance), 4), 
            n = n())

kable(summary_stats)
```

From the summary statistics, it can be seen that the factor combination with the 
farthest average distance is when the middle and rear paper clips are attached to 
the airplane. However this combination also has the highest standard deviation, 
so these results had the most variation in distance out of all of the combinations. 
The combination with the shortest average distance was the group with no paper clips 
attached to the airplane at all. This group also had the smallest standard deviation, 
giving the most consistent results.

Analysis:
```{r}
model1 <- lm(Distance ~ Nose*Middle*Rear, data=paper_airplane)
f_stat <- summary(model1)$fstatistic
pval <- pf(f_stat[1], df1=f_stat[2], df2=f_stat[3], lower.tail=FALSE)
```

Given that the overall model p-value is `r round(pval, 4)`, at significance level $\alpha=0.05$ 
there is not statistically significance evidence to reject to the null hypothesis 
$H_0$ that $\beta_1 = \beta_2 = \beta_3 = \beta_4 = \beta_5 = \beta_6 = \beta_7 = 0$, so 
the conclusion is that no combination of the factors (paper clip on the nose, middle, 
rear) has any impact on paper airplane flight distance.

```{r}
output_table <- signif(summary(model1)$coefficients, 4)
output_table[,] <- as.character(output_table[,])

kable(output_table)
```

This conclusion remains constant with the individual coefficient p-values as well. 
At the Bonferroni-adjusted significance level of 
$\alpha_{Bonferroni} = \frac{0.05}{7} = 0.007$,
the large p-values do not reject any of the null hypotheses, so none of the predictors 
have a statistically significant effect on flight distance.

However, the data runs the risk of not fulfilling the linear regression model's 
assumptions of normality, no structure to the data, and constant variance, so these 
should be checked for completeness.

\textbf{Check for normality:}

Figure 1:
```{r}
hist(model1$residuals, xlab="Residuals", main="Paper Airplane Flight Distance Residuals")

qqnorm(model1$residuals)
qqline(model1$residuals)

shapiro_pval <- shapiro.test(model1$residuals)$p.value
```

The residuals of the data appear normally distributed in Figure 1, but to see this 
easier, the QQ-plot shows the residuals roughly following the theoretical normal 
values while they are negative, however they start to diverge from normality slightly 
as they become greater positive values. Finally, at $\alpha=0.05$, the Shapiro-Wilk 
test concludes that there is statistically significant evidence that the residuals do not 
follow a normal distribution, rejecting $H_0$ with a p-value of `r round(shapiro_pval, 4)`. 
Based on the analysis of the residuals, it is concluded that the paper airplane flight distance 
data is not normally distributed, thus violating linear regression's normality assumption. 
However, as will be seen later, this violation of normality may not be that big of 
an issue due to the central limit theorem.

\textbf{Structure to the data:}

Figure 2:
```{r}
x <- 1:length(model1$residuals)
plot(model1$residuals ~ x, ylab="Residuals", main="Residuals vs. Order of Data Collection")
```

Based on Figure 2, there are no patterns, so it appears that there is no structure to 
the data.

\textbf{Check for constant variance (homoscedasticity):}

Figure 3:
```{r}
plot(model1$residuals ~ model1$fitted.values,
     xlab="Fitted Values", ylab="Residuals", main="Residuals vs. Fitted Values")
```

Based on Figure 3, there is no concern about inequality of variance to the data.

Overall, the model assumptions were met except for normality, so a permutation test 
should be done to circumvent this assumption and maintain a normal Type I and Type II 
error rate.

\textbf{Permutation test:}
```{r, message=FALSE}
perm_f <- NA
reps <- 10000
for (i in 1:reps){
  perm_data <- paper_airplane
  perm_data$Distance <- sample(perm_data$Distance)
  perm_f[i] <- summary(lm(Distance ~ Nose*Middle*Rear, data=perm_data))$fstatistic[1]
}

perm_pval <- sum(perm_f >= f_stat[1]) / reps
```

From the permutation test, a p-value of `r perm_pval` is obtained, which is very 
similar to the p-value of `r round(pval, 4)` from the standard test result. At $\alpha=0.05$, 
$H_0$ is not rejected so the conclusion that the factors have no effect on paper airplane 
flight distance is upheld. Since the original p-value was not on the cusp of the rejection 
region, the permutation test outputs a similar test result. Additionally, with a large 
enough sample size like the one present in this study ($n=96$), the the normality assumption 
is not super strict because of the central limit theorem, so the p-value of the permutation 
test is very similar to the original p-value. Therefore, no additional analysis of 
the individual effects is necessary (e.g. running multiple permutation tests) since 
it can be seen that none of the predictors are significant.


# Discussion

This study assessed the impact of mass and weight distribution on paper airplane 
flight distance. By attaching paper clips to three spots on the paper airplane, I 
explored whether these differences in airplane architecture had any impact in how 
far the paper airplane was able to travel. The order of data collection was randomized 
through a sampling function, and a linear regression model and permutation test were 
employed for statistical analysis. The results suggest that weight 
distribution does not affect drag, lift, or subsequently flight distance of airplanes, 
but we know that this is quite the contrary in real aircraft. 
Although this study did not discover any statistically 
significant results, it is still a plausible method to to analyze how weight, drag, and 
lift factors affect the flight of real airplanes, and other studies have been more successful 
in their findings, discovering statistically significant evidence relating to airplane 
weight and nose construction \cite{Puspita2019}. 

A potential issue that 
could have altered my results was my throwing variability of the paper airplanes. 
Differences in the angle I threw the plane at, the strength I used to throw it, and 
consistency (or lack of) of my throws may have introduced variability into the experiment 
unrelated 
to the factors of interest. In the future, introducing blocks related to different 
throwers could help aid in reducing this unwanted variability. Furthermore, there 
was a breach in the assumption of normality needed for the linear regression model. 
After the data was collected, the structure of the data was analyzed and it was 
not normally distributed. However, given my sufficient sample size of $n=96$, the 
violation of this assumption should not affect much of the experiment due to the 
central limit theorem, which claims that the regression coefficients approximate 
normality if the sample size is sufficiently large. Still, to circumvent the parametric 
assumption, a permutation test was done for completeness, however it ended in the same 
conclusion. The linear regression model's assumptions of constant variance and no 
structure to the data were upheld after looking at the residuals. Lastly, some 
limitations of the experiment were my inconsistent throwing technique, which gradually 
improved over time, and the deterioration of the paper airplane over time. The nose 
of the paper airplane became crumpled with successive trials, but the randomization 
of the order of data collection helped prevent a link of the wear and tear of the plane 
to a specific combination of factors. All in all, research points to the notion that 
weight of paper airplanes does affect flight distance, but more investigation will be 
required to find significant results within my specific experimental design.
